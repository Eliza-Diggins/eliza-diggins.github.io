It's a little know fact (at least it was) that I <u>love-love-love</u> snapping turtles. They're physiologically incredible and they're suprisingly cute
from a safe distance!
<p>
There are 2 types of snapping turtle found in the United States, both of family <i>Chelydridae</i>: the common snapping turtle (<i>Chelydra serpentina</i>) and the alligator snapping turtle
(<i>Macrochelys temminckii</i>). The <i>Chelydridae</i> family has other exant genera in other parts of the world, and continuing research concerning the true number of species generally
group into <i>Macrochelys temminckii</i>.

The common snapping turtle is already pretty cool; weighing in at 6-10 Kg, they're pretty large turtles and they're known for their fiesty (or chompy?) disposition. Generally speaking, these guys prescribe to the philosophy of "chomp now, worry never."
Suprisingly (given their love of chomping), these guys are mostly herbavours; but they're also opportunistic and will take advantage of passing ducklings (chomp) and sometimes
small fish (chomp chomp). What's really cool is that they hibernate in the mud at the bottom of ponds and similar bodies of water (many of which freeze over). If they get low on oxygen, they <u>stick their heads out of the mud, open their mouths and pull oxygen out of the water!</u> If that doesn't work, they just shift to anearobic pathways cause, ya know, why not?

Alligator snapping turtles are even better. Unimpressed by the 10 kg common snapper? I raise you the <u>150+ kg</u> alligator snapping turtle. They tend to be between 1-3 feet long, and honestly they're cute as hell. Like honestly, they're a little thick and they basically fall out of their plastron.

<p>
But cuteness aside, my favorite fact about the Alligator snapper is its <i>vermiform</i>! These guys have a little worm like thing at the ends of their tongue 
that they wiggle around underwater until an unsuspecting fish comes along to check out the worm with the fancy feet and then (*mega-chomp*) the friendly fish just became 2 much less alive chunks of food. Its my favorite version of Peckham's mimicry!

I could go on about this forever, but if you're not convinced to adopt a new favorite reptile, I'll leave you with one final argument:
