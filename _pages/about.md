   I'm a theoretical astrophysicist and mathematician at the University of Utah. My research is shared between the Department of Physics
and Astronomy, where I study galaxy cluster dynamics and gravitational theory; and the School of Dentistry, where I work on mathematical models
of trade-mediated pathogens in complex global trade networks. 



Research Interests
==================

As a researcher, I am deeply committed to the philosophy of interdisciplinary and holistic exploration of science in all its
forms. I am, first and foremost, a theoretical astrophysicist, but I make time to explore areas of interest in other disciplines, particularly
epidemiology and applied mathematics. I am fascinated by the methodological, cultural, and philosophical cross-over between
these various fields of scientific inquiry and the different ways in which each informs my thinking on research questions in the others.

In the menus below, you can find some details on my research interests and current projects in each of these areas.

  <p>My research interests in physics focus on the nature of extragalactic phenomena and how they inform our understanding of
more fundamental physical truths. I'm particularly interested in the nature of gravity, dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmological history
of our universe. I believe that our understanding of each of these phenomena is incomplete and that one of the next frontiers in physics could occur 
due to a paradigm shift in the way we understand the dynamics of our universe. 

Right now, my research largely focuses on galaxy clusters and their role in shaping our understanding of the universe. Galaxy clusters are
the largest relaxed structures in the universe and can tell us a lot about the nature of dark matter, gravity, and cosmology. Unfortunately, these
structures are not as well understood as we would like and many of the micro-physical processes underlying the hot, X-ray emitting gas in these systems
are incompletely described leading to systemic issues in our use of these systems for cosmology. My core focus is two-fold. Firstly, what are the 
relevant physical constraints on these systems? How does the plasma physics of the gaseous component drive phenomena? How can we better model these processes
to constrain our observational measurements? Secondly, how can galaxy clusters instruct us in the nature of gravity? Are they entirely self-consistent with General Relativity?
Modified gravity theories are known to break down in galaxy cluster regimes... Why does this happen? What can that tell us about the underlying nature of the universe?

To pursue this research, I work as a member of the <a href="https://www.astro.utah.edu/~wik/">X-ray Astrophysics group at the University of Utah</a> (led by Dr. Daniel R. Wik). I focus on analytic, semi-analytic, and numerical
models of phenomena in galaxy clusters in both standard gravitational paradigms and in modified paradigms. In doing this research, I have contributed to our theoretical
understanding of the dynamics of both modified gravity theories and galaxy clusters in general. I am also a very active software developer for numerical approaches to these problems. See
my software page for a description of my code projects and those that I make heavy use of!

Research Philosophy
===================

I believe in the inherent importance of scientific progress for its own sake and for the sake of the human endeavour. I am staunchly against
isolationism in science and believe that science in both its practice and its implementation should be a diverse and inherently human affair. 
Diversity in science is important to me and, in my opinion, one of the most important things we can use to improve the productivity, communicativity, and impact of
science on all scales. 

In my research, I strive to be radically skeptical and challenge paradigms for the sake of forcing them to stand up to challenge. It is my philosophy that
scientific skepticism drives the division between (as Kuhn would say) "normal science," and paradigm shifting research. In my research, I allow normal science, as done by myself and by others, to
drive my skeptical assessment of the paradigms we exist within. I do not believe that normal science is esoteric or unimportant, but instead that (with as much 
skepticism as can be mustered) normal science should be seen as a probe by which to methodologically challenege every aspect of every paradigm seeking faults which might lead to
new science.
