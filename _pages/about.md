Hello! I’m Eliza Diggins, a theoretical astrophysicist and Ph.D. student at the [University of California, Berkeley](www.berkeley.edu).
My research focuses on the dynamics of large structures in the universe and what they can tell us about fundamental physics like
the nature of gravity, dark matter, and dark energy. I combine high-resolution simulations of the universe with observational data
and analytical methods to study these connections between our universe and the laws that govern it.

Before joining the department at Berkeley, I was based at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/), where I earned
my undergraduate degrees in Physics and Mathematics and held dual research roles in both the 
[Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.utah.edu/) as a Parmley Fellow, and in
the [School of Dentistry](https://dentistry.utah.edu/) as a Wilkes Climate Scholar.

Beyond my research, I am very passionate about physics education, science communication, and advocacy for LGBTQIA+ and
neurodiverse communities in STEM. I give frequent public talks on various topics in astrophysics, often as part of the
[Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/) series. I am also an avid outdoors enthusiast, and enjoy hiking, climbing,
and whitewater rafting in my free time.

## My Research at a Glance

One of the most exciting aspects of astrophysics is its reliance on a broad spectrum of fundamental
physics—from quantum mechanics and plasma physics to fluid dynamics and general relativity. My research
spans multiple scales and systems, using astrophysics as a lens to understand the laws that govern
the universe and, in turn, using those laws to deepen our understanding of the systems we observe.
I work across theory, computation, and data analysis—developing numerical tools, running
large-scale simulations, and applying analytical methods to study phenomena such as galaxy clusters,
cosmic structure formation, plasma microphysics, and the dynamics of astrophysical fluids.

**Topics I'm Currently Interested In:**

- The nature of astrophysical plasmas, in particular their non-ideal behavior (e.g., turbulence, conduction, viscosity) 
  and the influence these processes have on observable properties of various systems.
- The thermodynamics of hot plasma in galaxy clusters; particularly its influence on X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observables.
- The inconsistencies in galaxy cluster cosmology.

Beyond academia, I am deeply committed to building a more inclusive, empathetic,
and engaged scientific community. My advocacy work is shaped by both lived experience 
and a belief that science should be a tool for liberation, not exclusion. I focus on:

- Inclusive Pedagogy: Designing physics curricula that center diverse learners,
  minimize gatekeeping, and support active learning environments where everyone belongs.
- Science Communication: Translating complex scientific ideas—cosmic structure, machine learning,
  and beyond—into accessible formats through public talks, writing, and hands-on outreach programs.
- Community Work & Organizing: Actively participating in initiatives 
  that uplift LGBTQIA+, trans, and neurodiverse communities. My work has included:
- Organizing events like Transgender Day of Visibility that center joy and communal care.
- Facilitating peer support spaces in both academic and nonprofit settings.
- Speaking and storytelling in support of queer youth mental health and access to care.
