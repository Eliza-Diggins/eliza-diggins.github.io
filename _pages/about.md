Hello! I’m Eliza Diggins, a theoretical astrophysicist and Ph.D. candidate at the [University of California, Berkeley](www.berkeley.edu),
where I work at the intersection of cosmology and computation, using galaxy clusters and other astrophysical systems
to probe both large-scale structure and the small-scale physics, like turbulence and conduction, that govern their evolution.

Before Berkeley, I was based at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/), where I held dual research roles in both
the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.utah.edu/) and the [School of Dentistry](https://dentistry.utah.edu/)—bridging computational astrophysics
with biomedical data science.

### My Roles:

- <i class="fi fi-rr-telescope"></i> **Physics and Astronomy**:  
  <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
    <div style="flex: 1 1 400px; min-width: 280px;">
      I’m a computational astrophysicist in the <a href="https://www.astro.utah.edu/~wik/"><strong>X-ray Astronomy
      Group</strong></a>, where I study galaxy clusters—how they merge, evolve, and radiate in X-rays. My work 
      combines cosmology with fundamental physics to understand the largest bound structures in the universe.
      I focus on:
      <ul>
        <li>Building and maintaining software tools for high-resolution astrophysical simulations, initial conditions
            and computational geometry.</li>
        <li>Collaborating with large-scale surveys like <a href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA"><strong>eROSITA</strong></a> to compare theoretical models with observations.</li>
        <li>Analyzing data from cosmological simulations, especially <a href="https://www.tng-project.org"><strong>IllustrisTNG</strong></a>, to investigate the effects of turbulence, shocks, and plasma physics on cluster observables.</li>
      </ul>

- **<i class="fi fi-rr-microscope"></i> Dentistry**:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">

  <div style="flex: 1 1 400px; min-width: 280px;">
    As the lead data scientist in the <a href="https://dentistry.utah.edu/research/labs/weller"><strong>Weller Lab</strong></a>, I explore the connections between rare diseases and autoimmune disorders. My key responsibilities include:
    <ul>
      <li>Leading big-data and machine learning projects using datasets from millions of patients.</li>
      <li>Investigating the causes and mechanisms of disease.</li>
      <li>Leading a team of fellow data scientists in these efforts.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>


### <i class="fi fi-rr-megaphone"></i> Advocacy and Outreach:
Beyond academia, I am deeply committed to advocacy:
- Promoting **better pedagogy** and **inclusivity** in physics.
- Engaging the public through **science communication**.
- Actively participating in **social work** and **activism** for **LGBTQIA+** and **neurodiverse** communities.

On this website, you'll find resources and insights into my various projects and endeavors.
