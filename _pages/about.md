Hello! I‚Äôm Eliza Diggins, a theoretical astrophysicist and Ph.D. candidate at the [University of California, Berkeley](www.berkeley.edu),
where I work at the intersection of cosmology and computation, using galaxy clusters and other astrophysical systems
to probe both large-scale structure and the small-scale physics, like turbulence and conduction, that govern their evolution.

Before Berkeley, I was based at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/), where I held dual research roles in both
the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.utah.edu/) and the [School of Dentistry](https://dentistry.utah.edu/)‚Äîbridging computational astrophysics
with biomedical data science.

## My Roles:

    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1 1 auto">
      I‚Äôm a computational astrophysicist in the 
      <a href="https://www.astro.utah.edu/~wik/"><strong>X-ray Astronomy Group</strong></a>, 
      where I study galaxy clusters‚Äîhow they merge, evolve, and radiate in X-rays. My work 
      combines cosmology with fundamental physics to understand the largest bound structures in the universe.  
      I focus on:
      <ul>
        <li>Building and maintaining software tools for high-resolution astrophysical simulations, initial conditions, and computational geometry.</li>
        <li>Collaborating with large-scale surveys like 
            <a href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA"><strong>eROSITA</strong></a> to compare theoretical models with observations.</li>
        <li>Analyzing data from cosmological simulations, especially 
            <a href="https://www.tng-project.org"><strong>IllustrisTNG</strong></a>, to investigate the effects of turbulence, shocks, and plasma physics on cluster observables.</li>
      </ul>

    As the lead data scientist in the <a href="https://dentistry.utah.edu/research/labs/weller"><strong>Weller Lab</strong></a>,
    I explored the connections between rare diseases and autoimmune disorders. My primary interests included:
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and implementing machine learning pipelines to analyze de-identified EHR and claims data 
          from millions of patient records across regional and national networks.</li>
      <li>Developing statistical models to investigate potential links between oral conditions, systemic disease progression, 
          and social determinants of health.</li>
      <li>Collaborating with dentists, immunologists, and computational biologists to guide translational research and 
          shape data-driven hypotheses for clinical trials and intervention design.</li>
      <li>Mentoring research assistants and junior data scientists while helping to publish our findings in both 
          biomedical and dental science journals.</li>
    </ul>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
    I‚Äôm developing new numerical tools to study the dynamics of galaxy clusters in simulations and data‚Äîespecially the role of turbulence and conduction in the intracluster medium. I'm currently working on:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Designing a differential geometry library for astrophysical and geophysical simulations.</li>
    <li>Running simulations to explore merger shocks in eROSITA-like clusters.</li>
    <li>Publishing methods to analyze plasma microphysics in IllustrisTNG and similar datasets.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 1em;">
    (Bonus: If you care about numerical stability, open-source modeling tools, or how baryons behave on cluster scales‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk.)

## <i class="fi fi-rr-megaphone"></i> Advocacy and Outreach:

Beyond academia, I am deeply committed to building a more inclusive, empathetic,
and engaged scientific community. My advocacy work is shaped by both lived experience 
and a belief that science should be a tool for liberation, not exclusion. I focus on:

- Inclusive Pedagogy: Designing physics curricula that center diverse learners,
  minimize gatekeeping, and support active learning environments where everyone belongs.
- Science Communication: Translating complex scientific ideas‚Äîcosmic structure, machine learning,
  and beyond‚Äîinto accessible formats through public talks, writing, and hands-on outreach programs.
- Community Work & Organizing: Actively participating in initiatives 
  that uplift LGBTQIA+, trans, and neurodiverse communities. My work has included:
- Organizing events like Transgender Day of Visibility that center joy and communal care.
- Facilitating peer support spaces in both academic and nonprofit settings.
- Speaking and storytelling in support of queer youth mental health and access to care.
