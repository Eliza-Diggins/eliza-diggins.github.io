Hello! Iâ€™m **Eliza Diggins**, a theoretical astrophysicist and data scientist currently at the **[University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu)**. I hold positions in both the **[Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.astro.utah.edu)** and the **[School of Dentistry](https://dentistry.utah.edu)**.

### <i class="fas fa-star"></i> My Roles:
- **<i class="fas fa-telescope"></i> Physics and Astronomy**:  
  I work as a computationalist in the **[X-ray Astronomy Group](https://www.astro.utah.edu/~wik/)**, focusing on models and simulations of galaxy clusters, their mergers, and their observational properties. My work includes:
  - Developing software for astrophysical research.
  - Collaborating with surveys like **[eROSITA](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA)**.
  - Analyzing simulations, particularly the **[IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org)** simulations.

- **<i class="fas fa-tooth"></i> Dentistry**:  
  As the lead data scientist in the **[Weller Lab](https://dentistry.utah.edu/research/labs/weller)**, I explore the connections between rare diseases and autoimmune disorders. My key responsibilities include:
  - Leading big-data and machine learning projects using datasets from millions of patients.
  - Investigating the causes and mechanisms of disease.
  - Leading a team of fellow data scientists in these efforts.

### <i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Advocacy and Outreach:
Beyond academia, I am deeply committed to advocacy:
- Promoting **better pedagogy** and **inclusivity** in physics.
- Engaging the public through **science communication**.
- Actively participating in **social work** and **activism** for **LGBTQIA+** and **neurodiverse** communities.

On this website, you'll find resources and insights into my various projects and endeavors.
