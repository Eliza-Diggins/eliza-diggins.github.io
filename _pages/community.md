As a transgender woman and as an autistic one, I've been very fortunate to have the support, privilege, and good luck to receive
the opportunities for personal growth and career advancement that have lead to the platform I have now. As a member of these deeply marginalized communities,
it has always been important to me that I do everything I can to support fellow trans and autistic people who have been less 
fortunate and who deserve all the same opportunities I was lucky to receive. On this page, you can find some information about
the causes that are important to me, the ways I'm giving back to my community, and (most importantly) things you can do to support
these communities.

Encircle provides community support resources to LGBTQ youth and adults through its "homes" throughout Utah, which host
events, peer support networks, and other critical support infrastructure for the LGBTQ community. 

I am the facilitator of the transgender adult friendship circle at the Salt Lake City Encircle home. The mission
of friendship circles at Encircle is to provide marginalized guests with opportunities to build community, friendships, and 
get peer-to-peer support in a safe environment. I, along with my amazing team of co-facilitators, run two transgender support groups on 
Friday nights from 6:30pm to 8:00pm. We provide a smaller support group for those guests who might struggle in a larger group setting
(4-8 people) as well as a large friendship circle (which I facilitate) which typically has an attendance of 15-20 guests. 

New group members are always welcome, just show up on Fridays! If you'd like to take a tour of the Encircle SLC home, you can sign
up for one below.

Encircle also offers therapy services, community events, and a host of other resources.
