Work experience
======
* January 2020 - January 2021
  * Undergraduate researcher, University of Utah Department of Mathematics
  * Research summary:
    * Studied the deposition characteristics of SARS COV-2 virions in the respiratory track and modeled the resultant
      onset of infection.
    * Focus on determining the role of respiratory topology in the behavior of a COVID infection for people with pre-existing conditions.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Fred Adler

* March 2022 - Present
  * Researcher, University of Utah School of Dentistry
  * Research summary:
    * Study the emergence and epidemiological behavior of trade mediated pathogens in international trade networks.
    * Construct early warning systems to identify source countries and commodities of emergent trade mediated pathogens.
    * Determine the extent to which climate change impacts the emergence of trade-mediated pathogens.
    * Supervisor: Dr. Melodie Weller
* April 2022 - Present
  * Researcher, University of Utah Department of Physics and Astronomy
  * Research summary:
    * Study the behavior of galaxy clusters in isolation and in binary merger scenarios to probe new physics and extend our knowledge of cosmology.
    * Use the intricate dynamics of galaxy clusters to constrain non-newtonian gravitational theories and explore the extent to which these theories could compete with LCDM.
    * Supervisor: Dr. Daniel Wik
