<h2>Why I Do Science</h2>
<p>
  As a multidisciplinary scientist, I'm often asked: <strong>"Why explore such varied fields? What’s the common thread?"</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The answer lies in my deep fascination with <strong>knowledge-building through modeling</strong>. Whether I'm applying statistical models to rare disease dynamics or computational models to galaxy clusters, I find the process of discovery through simplification profoundly engaging. Modeling enables us to distill complex phenomena into understandable frameworks, driving meaningful insights and breakthroughs. At its core, science is about puzzle-solving, and I am deeply enamored with the complexity and challenge of the puzzles I choose to solve. Furthermore, I believe that no two fields are entirely separate. In many ways, the art of modern science is to bring knowledge from one place to another to contend with new puzzles.

<h2>Areas of Interest / Current Work</h2>

<div class="accordion-container">
  <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-meteor"></i> <strong>Astrophysics</strong></button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      My primary scientific role is as a computational astrophysicist in the 
      <a href="https://www.astro.utah.edu/~wik/" target="_blank">X-ray Astronomy Group</a> at the 
      <a href="https://www.utah.edu" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>. My work focuses on the study of 
      <strong>galaxy clusters</strong>, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe. Due to their unique dynamics, 
      these systems serve as ideal laboratories for testing our theories of <strong>gravity, cosmology, dark matter,</strong> and 
      <strong>dynamics</strong>. However, our understanding of galaxy clusters remains incomplete, necessitating further research 
      to fully harness their potential for probing fundamental physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I primarily focus on simulations of galaxy clusters and their mergers, including developing software to build models 
      of these systems for simulation purposes. I am one of the core developers of the 
      <a href="https://github.com/jzuhone/cluster-generator" target="_blank"><code>cluster_generator</code></a> project, which produces 
      initial conditions for galaxy cluster simulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to simulations, I engage in theoretical work, particularly regarding <strong>dark matter</strong> and 
      <strong>gravity</strong>. My research has led to novel constraints on non-Newtonian gravitational theories using galaxy cluster observations. 
      I continue to explore theoretical implications for galaxy clusters, including various forms of novel gravity, 
      plasma phenomena, and geometric deviations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complementing my theoretical work, I participate in observational and analytical projects. Notably, I work closely with 
      cosmological simulations like <a href="https://www.tng-project.org" target="_blank">IllustrisTNG</a> to study galaxy clusters 
      at the population level, understanding their formation history and dynamical states. I have also collaborated with the 
      <a href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA" target="_blank">eROSITA all-sky survey</a> to identify novel systems visible in 
      hard-band X-ray emission. This effort led to the development of <a href="https://github.com/eliza-diggins/pyXMIP" target="_blank"><code>pyXMIP</code></a>, 
      a Bayesian cross-matching library designed to search for novel source detections in all-sky surveys.

  <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-disease"></i> <strong>Epidemiology</strong></button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      My work in epidemiology focuses on modeling the dynamics of <strong>rare diseases</strong> and understanding the 
      intersection between <strong>infectious diseases</strong> and <strong>autoimmune conditions</strong>. I leverage advanced 
      <strong>statistical analysis</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>big data techniques</strong> to uncover insights from 
      large-scale patient datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lead data scientist in the 
      <a href="https://dentistry.utah.edu/research/labs/weller" target="_blank">Weller Lab</a> at the 
      <a href="https://www.utah.edu" target="_blank">University of Utah School of Dentistry</a>, I manage patient datasets that are 
      10 to 100 times larger than those typically seen in the literature. This has positioned our work at the forefront of 
      <strong>rare disease research</strong>, enhancing both the quality and statistical rigor of our findings. The recent emergence
      of massive-scale electronic health record (EHR) datasets has provided a novel tool in precision epidemiology research which we
      have harnessed to understand the dynamics of even extremely rare disease phenotypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My role involves not only technical development but also cross-disciplinary collaboration. I have applied my computational skills 
      to open new avenues of research within the lab, bridging gaps between disciplines and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible 
      in understanding <strong>autoimmune disease mechanisms</strong>. This has led to impactful research that has been presented at 
      both national and international conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my technical contributions, I am dedicated to mentoring and developing a team of younger researchers. Together, we aim to 
      expand upon the foundations I have laid, ensuring the continued growth and success of our research in <strong>epidemiology</strong>.

  <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-square-root-alt"></i> <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong></button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Applied mathematics is a cornerstone of my research, underpinning both my astrophysics and epidemiology projects. My focus lies in developing 
      and refining <strong>numerical methods</strong> and <strong>algorithmic approaches</strong> to tackle complex scientific problems. These methods 
      are tailored to the unique challenges presented by my diverse fields of study.
    </p>
    <p>
      In astrophysics, I am particularly interested in addressing computational challenges within <strong>non-Cartesian geometries</strong>. 
      This involves creating efficient algorithms for simulations of systems that exhibit <strong>spherical, cylindrical,</strong> or 
      other complex geometries. These innovations are crucial for accurately modeling galaxy clusters, their interactions, and the dynamic 
      behaviors of plasma in the intra-cluster medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in epidemiology, I develop statistical models and data processing algorithms to handle the vast and intricate datasets arising 
      from <strong>electronic health records (EHR)</strong>. This work ensures that we can extract meaningful insights, even from the most 
      complex and high-dimensional data.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ongoing research aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical computation, ensuring that numerical methods are not only 
      theoretically sound but also computationally efficient and applicable to real-world data. Whether it's improving interpolation 
      techniques for physical models or optimizing simulations for non-standard geometries, applied mathematics remains a critical 
      tool in advancing my scientific endeavors.

<h2>Research Ethos (How I Do Science)</h2>

<p>
  I believe in the inherent importance of scientific progress for its own sake and for the sake of the human endeavor. I am staunchly against
  isolationism in science and believe that science in both its practice and its implementation should be a diverse and inherently human affair.
  Diversity in science is important to me and, in my opinion, one of the most important things we can use to improve the productivity, communicativity, and impact of
  science on all scales.
</p>
<p>
  In my research, I strive to be radically skeptical and challenge paradigms for the sake of forcing them to stand up to challenge. It is my philosophy that
  scientific skepticism drives the division between (as Kuhn would say) "normal science," and paradigm-shifting research. In my research, I allow normal science, as done by myself and by others, to
  drive my skeptical assessment of the paradigms we exist within. I do not believe that normal science is esoteric or unimportant, but instead that (with as much
  skepticism as can be mustered) normal science should be seen as a probe by which to methodologically challenge every aspect of every paradigm seeking faults which might lead to
  new science.
</p>
<p>
  As a researcher, I am deeply committed to the philosophy of interdisciplinary and holistic exploration of science in all its
  forms. I am, first and foremost, a theoretical astrophysicist, but I make time to explore areas of interest in other disciplines, particularly
  epidemiology and applied mathematics. I am fascinated by the methodological, cultural, and philosophical cross-over between
  these various fields of scientific inquiry and the different ways in which each informs my thinking on research questions in the others.
