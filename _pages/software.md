All joking aside, its no secret that physicists spend a great deal of their time on the verge of tears (you heard it here first) because their C (for FORTRAN) code isn't running
or (heaven forbid) they can't find the answer they need on stack exchange. I won't even mention how annoying this website can be to work on!
<p>
Unfortunately, scientific software is often very niche and isn't easy to find, let alone use. This becomes an extra nuisance because *some people* (cough cough physicists) don't seem particularly
interested in writing good documentation or any documentation for that matter. Fortunately, I actually quite enjoy developing software! For that reason, I've used this page
to feature some of the excellent code that I use in my day-to-day research. Only a few of these codes are ones that I've personally worked on developing, but they are all invaluable tools
for the sort of research that I do!
