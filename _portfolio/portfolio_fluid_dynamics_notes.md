This page contains my notes from ASTRON C202: Fluid Dynamics at UC Berkeley, compiled during the Fall 2025 semester.
The notes cover a range of topics in fluid dynamics, including fundamental principles, equations of motion,
and applications in astrophysics. These should not be taken as authoritative
or complete, but rather as a resource for myself and others interested in the subject. 
The notes cover a range of topics including:

- Basics of fluid dynamics
- Equations of motion
- Turbulence and instabilities
- Applications in astrophysics
- Numerical methods in fluid dynamics

The notes are available as a PDF which can be viewed below or downloaded directly.
