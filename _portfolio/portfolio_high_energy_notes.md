This page contains my notes from ASTRON C254: High Energy Astrophysics at UC Berkeley. The notes are a living document
and will be updated as I continue to learn more about high energy astrophysics. These should not be taken as authoritative
or complete, but rather as a resource for myself and others interested in the subject. The notes cover a range of topics including:

- Basics of high energy astrophysics
- Radiation mechanisms
- Accretion mechanisms and disks

The notes are available as a PDF which can be viewed below or downloaded directly.
