This talk was given in the format of a mini-lecture (45 minutes) to the undergraduate cosmology class at the University of Utah. In it, I described the role that
scientific skepticism plays in our work as scientists and described in detail the differences between MOND and the standard CDM cosmological picture. The basic theory of MOND was
covered along with its many faults. Some discussion was made as to the successes of MOND and their implications for probing new physics.
