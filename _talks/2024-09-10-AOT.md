**What does it take to cook up a galaxy like the Milky Way?**

In this lively, beer-friendly talk for [Astronomy on Tap](https://www.instagram.com/aotsaltlakecity), I unpacked how
astrophysicists use massive computer simulations—cosmological “test kitchens”—to
model galaxy formation and evolution. From dark matter scaffolding to
intergalactic feedback, we explored what ingredients you need,
what happens when you change the recipe, and why simulations are
both a scientific tool and a form of storytelling about our cosmic origins.

Embedded below are the slides from the talk. Unfortunately, there is no video of the 
talk being delivered.
