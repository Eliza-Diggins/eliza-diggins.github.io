**How did we get stars, planets... and beer? Cosmic collisions.**

In this energetic public talk for [Astronomy on Tap SLC](https://www.instagram.com/aotsaltlakecity), I explored how
crashes, smashes, and near-misses across the cosmos have shaped the very
fabric of our universe. From the birth of stars in turbulent clouds to the
violent mergers that create galaxies, collisions are not just commonâ€”they're
essential. We dove into how these cosmic impacts ignite stellar nurseries,
seed the building blocks of planets, and even help assemble the Milky Way itself.
Because sometimes, in the universe as in life, it takes a good collision to make
something beautiful.

Embedded below are the slides from the talk. Unfortunately, there is no video of the 
talk being delivered.
