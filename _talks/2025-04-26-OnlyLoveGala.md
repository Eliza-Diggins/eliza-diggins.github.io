On April 26th, 2025, I was honored to speak as a staff member at Encircle’s Only Love Gala, held
at Adobe in Lehi, Utah. This wasn’t just a fundraiser—it was a night filled with vulnerability,
celebration, and truth-telling from LGBTQ+ youth, families, and community members across the state.

My role at Encircle has never been just a job. It's social work rooted in hope: helping young
people feel seen, helping families heal, and helping communities grow stronger. That night, I
had the opportunity to share a piece of my own journey—how I came to Encircle, what I’ve learned
from the circles I facilitate, and why this work matters so much to me personally.

Together, we raised over $200,000 to support mental health services, family programs,
and drop-in spaces that make life brighter for queer youth across Utah and beyond.
