**How can we use gravitational waves to answer questions about the cosmos?**

In this public talk for [Astronomy on Tap SLC](https://www.instagram.com/aotsaltlakecity), I explore the basics of gravitational 
wave astronomy, including how we detect these systems and what they tell us about the systems
that generate them. I discuss the basics of gravitational wave cosmology and discuss some
of the critical results.

Embedded below are the slides from the talk. Unfortunately, there is no video of the 
talk being delivered.
